# **Card Shuffler**
A fun project that I made that shuffles various decks of cards.

I got this idea from https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas. It reminded me of a portion of a project we did in my AP Computer Science class where we made a solitare clone. I might make a full solitare clone in the future, but for now I've decided to just stick with the shuffler in a console setting.
